This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook for the Exercise 2 of the Data Wrangling section. The dataset used is called as “titanic”. 

# Load the dataset in R:

```{r}
titanic <- read.csv("F:/Springboard/Data Wrangling/titanic_original.csv", header = TRUE)
```

# Install following packages to munge data:

```{r}
install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)
```

# 1: Fill in the missing values for embarked with 'S' i.e. Southampton

```{r}
titanic <- titanic %>% mutate(embarked = ifelse(is.null(embarked), 'S', embarked))
```

# 2: Calculate the mean of Age and fill in the missing values

```{r}
titanic <- titanic %>% mutate(age = ifelse(is.na(age), mean(age, na.rm = TRUE), age))
```

# 3: Fill in the missing values for Lifeboat with "NA"

```{r}
titanic <- titanic %>% mutate(boat = sub("^$", "NA", boat))
```

# 4: Create new column "has_cabin_number"

```{r}
titanic <- titanic %>% mutate(has_cabin_number = ifelse(cabin == "", 0, 1))
```

# Export new clean dataset as csv:

```{r}
write.csv(titanic, "F:/Springboard/Data Wrangling/Exercise2_Titanic/titanic_clean.csv")
```
